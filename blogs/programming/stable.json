        "I'd like to convert everything in this project into blog form with some extra commentary, but for now please refer to the `paper|https://github.com/hypochoco/stable-nerf/blob/main/paper.pdf`.",
        "Essentially, there's been some interesting advancements in novel view synthesis, specifically in utilizing NeRF's (`Pixel NeRF|https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02190`) and Stable Diffusion (`Zero123|https://zero123.cs.columbia.edu`). In this project, we aim to utilize the priors from Stable Diffusion within the 3D machinery of Pixel NeRF to enhance novel view synthesis."

### Notes

#### Quick about me

Hey, thanks for visiting–I'm Daniel. My work focuses on art, architecture, and computer science. This site contains my recent projects and documents my processes and thoughts. If you share a curiosity, feel free to reach out.

#### About me

I grew up in a suburb of Colorado drawing and tinkering with electronics, which developed into a passion for design and problem solving. I recently graduate with an Sc.B. in Computer Science and Mathematics and an A.B. in Architecture from Brown University and am completing an Sc.M. in Computer Science (AI/ML track). Although these disciplines are seemingly disjoint, I find they're surprisingly similar in process. This website is a documentation of that process into curious fields within and adjacent to art, mathematics, and computer science.

#### Architecture

Lately, I’ve been interested in the applications of computer science in Architecture. The Boids project, for example, is a structure generated from Craig Reynolds’ classic algorithm that simulates flocking behavior in animals. By keeping a record of where each boid moves in relation to others, we're able to generate an interesting, organic structure.
